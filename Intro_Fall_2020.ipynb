        "We will be using the Python programming language to process sound signals using computer algorithms. You won't be expected to write your own code from scratch, unless you wish to do so for one of your projects, or to further your learning. \n",
        "\n",
        "We've chosen the Python programming language because it is especially simple to read and write, and because of its popularity across a vast number of engineering and music programming fields. As a result of this popularity, it's possible to find free Python libraries to support just about any music engineering project you may be interested in. \n",
        "\n",
        "A *library* is a collection of code written and shared by others that allows you to perform some more advanced tasks without having to write the code from scratch yourself. Instead, you can call a function from a pre-existing library. In this class we will frequently use a library called *ThinkDSP* (DSP stands for Digital Signal Processing), which provides a number of functions for working with audio signals.\n",

        "It's often easiest to use a program like Audacity to record, visualize, and manipulate audio, or to use a Digital Audio Workstation like Ableton Live, Logic, or Pro Tools. In each of these cases, however, what you're able to do is limited by the features and design of the program. As you begin to write your own code, you gain the ability to customize your own tools, and the sky is the limit of what you can create.\n",

        "\n",
        "Python is only useful when we have an environment to carry out the code we have written. The environment could be your local computer's Python interpreter, but in this class we will use Jupyter Notebooks hosted on Google's Colab service. What you're seeing here is a Jupyter Notebook--we'll call this a \"notebook\" going forward for conciseness.\n",
        "\n",
        "Notebooks are a popular way for researchers in data science or applied computational sciences to disseminate their work. This arose from the recent push for more transparency and reproducibility in all research. You can read about the principles of reproducible research [here](https://www.practicereproducibleresearch.org/core-chapters/1-intro.html).\n",
        "\n",
        "What is great about notebooks is it allows others to see your code and outputs in the order you ran them along with any text cells. It helps you organize your research in a cohesive fashion.\n",

        "## About Colab\n",
        "\n",
        "Colab is a Google Cloud product that hosts Jupyter Notebooks on your Google account. It is a great way to collaborate with anyone who has a Google account by sharing your notebook like any other Google drive document. Colab provides free on-demand runtimes that give you compute power in the cloud. This means that the code you run is carried out in standardized and powerful remote machines in Google's data centers - freeing users of buying/setting up their own machines to run code. This is especially useful for hardware-intensive tasks like deep learning, which require very expensive graphics cards.\n",

        "**Syntax**\n",
        "\n",
        "When writing code, you have to respect the syntax (rules) that Python expects, otherwise you get errors. Think of syntax as the grammar of a programming language. Human beings can handle grammatical errors when listening to someone or reading, and perhaps can use context and manage to understand the words even if the grammar is incorrect. Sometimes we make mistakes in our interpretation, but communication keeps flowing. In a computer language, there is no such flexibility. Syntax errors stop all communication between you and the computer. The computer cannot make assumptions and move on (we are not talking about AI here!). \n",
        "\n",
        "**Interpreted vs. Compiled languages**\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is an interpreted language, meaning you don't have to compile and then run the whole program; you could run the code one line at a time, and the *interpreter* immediately interprets your code one line at a time and gives you the results of your code. For a compiled language, on the other hand, the whole program has to compile correctly wihtout any errors before you can see any results. \n",
        "\n",
        "If you get an error in a line, you would still get results from the lines above before the program stops. Usually error messages tell you exactly what you need to do to fix a problem, so they are your friends and don't be afraid of them! \n",
        "\n",
        "**Variables**\n",
        "\n",
        "If you never programmed before, you should get familiar with the concept of a variable. A variable is something that you define by setting it equal to something else (like a number, or a text string, or the output of a function call). You are free to name variables as you wish, but try to make your names meaningful within the context of the code. Typing the name of the variable will print its value when you run the code. If you change the value of a variable, you have to rerun the cell that contains that change to make it stick.  "

        "\n",
        "You can adjust these values using the parameters `freq`, `amp`, and `offset`.\n",
        "\n",
        "A phase offset of 90 degrees turns a sine function into a cosine, or you can also create a cosine signal using the `CosSignal` class. \n",
        "\n",
        "You can also adjust parameters like the duration in seconds, the start time, and the frame rate--the sampling rate in samples per second--of your signal (you usually need a frame rate that's at least twice the highest frequency of your signal).\n",
        "\n",
        "Once you create a signal, you can make a wave *object* out of it. An object is an *instance* of a class. Instatiation refers to constructing an object from a class definition. \n",
        "\n",
        "An object contains the parameters you can adjust, as well as a set of *functions* you can use, like, for example, the `plot()` function in the code cell below. \n",
        "\n",
        "The ThinkDSP library has three major classes, each with different uses and functions defined on them. The relationship between these classes is described in the image below:\n",

This modulation is what we perceive as beats. The amplitude of the modulating cosine wave has two peaks per cycle, so the number of beats per second will be four, not two. So the number of beats per second is exactly the difference between the two frequencies.\" (Benson, p. 20)"
